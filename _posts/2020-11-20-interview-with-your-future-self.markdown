## How does our own bias get  in the middle of our design decisions? 

We are driven by how we are brought up, the way we think, our past and current relationships, our circle of friends, how fast we move, and how anxious we get with little things. These factors influence our style, the way we write, the colors we choose, the way we design products.

But we forget one thing… Our body and mind are constantly evolving towards a state that requires more and more attention.

### Takeaways

In this time-travel activity, I propose a Design Thinking activity to help you and your participants to interview your past and future selves:

- learn from past mistakes,
- identify any missed opportunities,
- recognize how new technologies, techniques, or methodologies could have helped past projects,
- consider your own potential future disabilities as you grow older
- account for global events that could impact the way we live.

### Don Norman's wisdom

I came across a recent article by Don Norman titled: [I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me). 

If you don't know Don Norman, he is one of the fathers of User Experience and he wrote a popular book back in the 80s called [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654).

In this recent article, Don Norman describes how much he didn't know about his future when he wrote his famous design book back in 1980:

<hr/>

<blockquote>"Do not think that thoughtful design is just for the elderly, or the sick, or the disabled.<br/>In the field of design, this is called<br/> <strong>inclusive design</strong> for a reason:<br/>It helps everyone."
<br>
<span>- Donald Norman, 2020</span>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

His article made me reflect on how biased we are towards our current conditions, abilities and mindset when we create solutions for others.

__We are a collection of our past, not our future.__

We are driven by how we were raised. Whether we were exposed to different beliefs, or how many relationships we had along the way, how many heartbreaks, etc. 

Because of our past experiences, in whatever profession we may choose, we will always make decisions based on how our present-self summons our collective past experiences.

### Interviewing your future-self

As a product designer, I am constantly thinking about the end-users and how they will interact with the design solutions I create. But what if I was blind myself? How different the solutions I design would be?


<blockquote>

</blockquote>

These question led me to create an inclusive design activity to help the teams developing empathy towards older adults and people with disabilities.

Imagine for a moment, that you are visited by your future-self, returning from 30 years in the future to have a Ask Me Anything (AMA) session with you Today.

You were no given much notice. you have to act quickly and think of some questions to ask your future-self.

<blockquote>What questions would you ask someone from the future?</blockquote>

### The Worksheet

The idea for this worksheet was sparked by Donald Norman’s reflection on how many products are badly designed for older adults and the lack of understanding of the needs of older adults (Norman, 2019). When using the worksheet, you can choose to interview your past or future self to reflect on lifestyles, health, career, and other areas of different periods in a life.

This worksheet focuses on creating an inclusive mindset from the standpoint that a lack of disability is, in fact, only temporary. Awareness of future disabilities or lifestyle changes could make us more aware of whom we are excluding today. If UX professionals anticipate that they will lose their current abilities, they will develop more inclusive mindsets.
