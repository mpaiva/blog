## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Marcelo Paiva.

I am fortunate to lead user experience design and research teams for large corporations, consult with startups to build efficient cross-functional teams, processes, and collaborative environments. 

During non-working hours, I share my learnings, successes, and failures with our UX community by hosting monthly events, advocating for accessibility and inclusion by design, not by compliance.
