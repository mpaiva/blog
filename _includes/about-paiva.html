          <p>I'm Marcelo Paiva. I manage research and design teams during the day, but the real learning happens in the evening, when I host UX meetups, present at conferences worldwide, and give back to the UX community by empowering product designers about the joy of knowledge sharing and team collaboration.</p>

          <p>My expertise is in building cross-functional teams to successfully architect, build, maintain, and scale Design Systems, while advocating for accessibility and fostering inclusive design practices.</p>
