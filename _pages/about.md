## I love what I do ðŸ˜ƒ

I am very fortunate to lead teams for large corporations, consult with startups to build efficient cross-functional practices, processes, and collaborative environments.

During non-working hours, I share my learnings, successes and failures with our UX community by hosting monthly events, advocating for accessibility and inclusion.
