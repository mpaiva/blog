## This is what I do.<br/>This is what I love... ❤️

I feel privileged and honored to have worked with many talented people. They were my teachers, and I am forever thankful for team members and leaders - the good and the bad. 

During non-working hours, I share my learnings, successes, and failures with our UX community by hosting monthly events and advocating for accessibility and inclusion.
