Many UX professionals struggle to incorporate accessibility considerations into their design process, resulting in poor experiences for users with disabilities. 

## It is an industry problem, and it leads to exclusion.

The lack of focus on content and accessibility in early design concepts often excludes people with disabilities from user research studies, leading to a gap in their user experience.

The typical product life-cycle focus on the bottom-line and rarely accounts for good UX for people with disabilities.

<blockquote>As UX professionals, it is our responsibility to create solutions that are inclusive and accessible to ALL users, regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, political affiliation, and status as a parent, in order to provide equitable and accessible experiences for everyone.</blockquote>

The following is a collection of notes and tips the UX+Fajitas community collected over the past couple of years on switching from Sketch to Figma. 

We have made the presentation deck available to help the community making the best decisions when migrating teams to Figma.

Some of the topics include:

1. Why Figma? Why now?
2. DesignOps for Figma
3. Plugins for efficient teams
4. Project Workflow 
5. Pro-tips
6. Figma Branching
7. Bridging Design and Development  
8. Distributed Design
