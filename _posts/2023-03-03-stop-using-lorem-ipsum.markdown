As UX professionals, we have a responsibility to ensure that our designs are inclusive and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Unfortunately, many designers and researchers struggle to incorporate accessibility considerations into their design process, which can result in poor experiences for users with disabilities. 

## It is an industry problem, and it leads to exclusion.

One of the biggest barriers to accessibility is poor content. If designers continue to use Lorem Ipsum content placeholders in early design concepts, people with disabilities that rely on assistive technologies like screen readers will continue to be excluded from early user research studies.

## Adopt a content-first practice 

So what can we do to change this behavior and create more inclusive designs? One solution is to focus on creating good content from the beginning using a content-first approach called "Priority Guides."

__Priority Guides__ are a way to focus on content design before interface design by creating a hierarchy of headlines and element blocks sorted by user needs. This content-first practice is well-described in A List Apart's article <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Priority Guides: A Content-First Alternative to Wireframes</a>, by Heleen van Nues and Lennart Overkamp.

## Bridging Content-first with Accessible Prototyping

To take this approach a step further, I'm excited to introduce "No Latin" (<a href="https://nolatin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nolatin.com</a>) - a free web-based app that converts Priority Guides into an accessible web prototype. 

The goal is to improve the user experience for people with disabilities by identifying and eliminating the use of Latin-based scripts (i.e., Lorem Ipsum) in the design industry and motivate UX professionals to write quality content early so people with disabilities can participate in research studies much earlier.

By combining a content-first approach with accessible prototyping, we can create designs that are not only more inclusive but also more efficient and effective. 

With <a href="https://nolatin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Latin</a>, designers can focus on creating quality content from the start and ensure that their designs are accessible to everyone.

## Conclusion


In conclusion, let's make a conscious effort to prioritize accessibility and inclusivity in our designs. As UX professionals, it is our responsibility to create solutions that are accessible to ALL users, regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, political affiliation, and status as a parent. 

Let's say goodbye to Lorem Ipsum and hello to accessible design for all.
