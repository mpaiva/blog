## How does our own bias get  in the middle of our design decisions? 

We are driven by how we are brought up, the way we think, our past and current relationships, our circle of friends, how fast we move, and how anxious we get with little things. These factors influence our style, the way we write, the colors we choose, the way we design products.

But we forget one thing… Our body and mind are constantly evolving towards a state that requires more and more attention.

Overview
In this time-travel activity, you’ll learn how to interview your past and future selves, where you will:

learn from past mistakes,
identify any missed opportunities,
recognize how new technologies, techniques, or methodologies could have helped past projects,
consider your own potential future disabilities as you grow older
account for global events that could impact the way we live.

<p class="caption"> Worksheet created by Marcelo Paiva inviting designers to think about their future self and the disabilities they may acquire over the years. </p>

The idea for this worksheet was sparked by Donald Norman’s reflection on how many products are badly designed for older adults and the lack of understanding of the needs of older adults (Norman, 2019). When using the worksheet, you can choose to interview your past or future self to reflect on lifestyles, health, career, and other areas of different periods in a life.

This worksheet focuses on creating an inclusive mindset from the standpoint that a lack of disability is, in fact, only temporary. Awareness of future disabilities or lifestyle changes could make us more aware of whom we are excluding today. If UX professionals anticipate that they will lose their current abilities, they will develop more inclusive mindsets.
