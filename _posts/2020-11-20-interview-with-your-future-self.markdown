## How does our own bias get  in the middle of our design decisions? 

We are driven by how we are brought up, the way we think, our past and current relationships, our circle of friends, how fast we move, and how anxious we get with little things. These factors influence our style, the way we write, the colors we choose, the way we design products.

But we forget one thing… Our body and mind are constantly evolving towards a state that requires more and more attention.

<hr/>

### Overview

In this time-travel activity, I propose an activity that focuses on creating an inclusive mindset from the standpoint that a lack of disability is, in fact, only temporary. 

Awareness of future disabilities or lifestyle changes could make us more aware of whom we are excluding today. If UX professionals anticipate that they will lose their current abilities, they will develop more inclusive mindsets.

#### After this activity, you will:

- learn from past mistakes,
- identify any missed opportunities,
- recognize how new technologies, techniques, or methodologies could have helped past projects,
- consider your own potential future disabilities as you grow older
- account for global events that could impact the way we live.

### Don Norman's wisdom

I came across a recent article by Don Norman titled: [I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me). 

If you don't know Don Norman, he is one of the fathers of User Experience and he wrote a popular book back in the 80s called [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654).

In this recent article, Don Norman describes how much he didn't know about his future when he wrote his famous design book back in 1980:

<hr/>

<blockquote>"Do not think that thoughtful design is just for the elderly, or the sick, or the disabled.<br/>In the field of design, this is called <strong>inclusive design</strong> for a reason: It helps everyone."
<br>
<span>- Donald Norman, 2020</span>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

His article made me reflect on how biased we are towards our current conditions, abilities and mindset when we create solutions for others.

<blockquote>We are a collection of our past, not our future.</blockquote>

We are driven by how we were raised. Whether we were exposed to different beliefs, or how many relationships we had along the way, how many heartbreaks, etc. 

Because of our past experiences, in whatever profession we may choose, we will always make decisions based on how our present-self summons our collective past experiences.

<hr/>

## Interviewing your future self

As a product designer, I am constantly thinking about the end-users and how they will interact with the design solutions I create. But what if I was blind myself? How differently would the solutions I design be?


<blockquote>
But what if I was blind myself?<br/>How differently would the solutions I design be?
</blockquote>

These question led me to create an inclusive design activity to help the teams developing empathy towards older adults and people with disabilities.

Imagine for a moment, that you are visited by your future self, returning from 30 years in the future to have a Ask Me Anything (AMA) session with you Today.

### Act quickly

You were not given much notice about this unexpected visit. You will have to act quickly and think of some questions to ask your future self.

<blockquote>What questions would you ask someone from the future?</blockquote>

## Design Thinking Activity

The following activity are broken into two parts:
1. __Ice breaker__ - a fun way to connect participants with their older figures.
2. __The Interview__ - four simple steps to help participants generating, prioritizing and answering hypothetical questions, followed by a moment of self-reflection.   

### Part 1: Ice Breaker
Envisioning you as an older person using the face editor application FaceApp.

- __Audience__ - Anyone looking to reflect on human behavior over time
- __Duration__ - 5-10 minutes
- __Expected Outcome__ - A fun way to empathise with your future conditions.
- __Preparation__ - Download the app from one of the following app stores:

<p class="caption"> Download the FaceApp application by scanning one of the QR codes displayed on this image.</p>

- __Using the app__ - Download the app from one of the following app stores:

### Part 2: The Interview

- __Preparation__ - Worksheet and photos from ice breaker activity
- __Audience__ - Anyone looking to reflect on human behavior over time
- __Duration__ - 5-10 minutes for each step
- __Expected Outcome__ - An open discussion about our current behaviors impact others and how changes in society shape our moral and intellectual values

##### Step 1: Create questions

If you could interview your future self, as someone who is much wiser and experienced, that have survived some hardships in life, seen the good in society, as well as new technological inventions, and been treated by the most advanced progress in science... what questions would you ask?

Consider some categories:

- __Living__: How the future has changed your way of living?
- __Health__: Has your health been dimininshed?
- __Relatives__: Has your family circle increased or decreased?
- __Professional__: How much have your professional life impacted others?
- __Disabilities__: Have the years brought you any permanent setbacks?
- __Technology__: How the exponential growth in technology changed society?
- __Society__: Have socio-economic gaps like gender, wealth and racism 
impacted your life or the world?
- __Bias__: Have you become aware of your own bias towards specific groups?
- __World__: Have any catastrophic events disrupted humanity?

#### Step 2: Challenge your questions

What if:
- If you could only ask one question?
- If you had only 30 seconds?
- If you could only ask about one of the above categories?

Bonus:
- What if you assume a future disability?

#### Step 3: Listen to your future self


Describe

#### Step 4: Reflect on unnecessary behaviors
