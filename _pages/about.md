### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Marcelo Paiva. 

I am fortunate to lead user experience design and research teams for large corporations, consult with startups to build efficient cross-functional teams, processes, and collaborative environments. 

During non-working hours, I share my learnings, successes, and failures with our UX community by hosting monthly events, advocating for Accessibility and Inclusion by design, not by compliance.

For the past 5 years, I have found a new passion as an educator, helping community members learn about user-centered design practices and management. I have developed UX curriculums for Bootcamps, conducted dozens of workshops, and spent hundreds of hours mentoring community members interested in career pathing, portfolio reviews, team dynamics, and enterprise-level architecture and design operations. 

This passion is evolving into helping professionals with all levels of disabilities to become designers and developers and build inclusive solutions with genuinely diverse teams.
